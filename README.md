Dataset Description
This dataset contains annual per capita personal income data for the United States and its states from 1997 to 2015. The data is presented in a tabular format, with each row representing a different state or region, and each column corresponding to a specific year within the given range.

Structure of the Dataset:
Rows: Each row represents a different geographic region, including all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and various aggregate regions.
Columns: Each column represents a specific year, ranging from 1997 to 2015. The data for each year is expressed in thousands of dollars, representing the per capita personal income for that specific year.

Variables:
Geographic Region: This includes various states and aggregate regions.
Year: Annual data from 1997 to 2015.
Per Capita Personal Income: The income for each year is expressed in thousands of dollars.

I think analyzing this dataset can provide the following insights:
Trends in personal income growth over a specific period.
Comparison of income levels across different states and regions.
Identification of states or regions with the highest and lowest per capita personal income.
Patterns and disparities in economic growth in the United States over the past twenty years.
